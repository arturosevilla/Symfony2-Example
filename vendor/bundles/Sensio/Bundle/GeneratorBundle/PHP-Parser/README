This is a PHP parser written in PHP.

This project is work in progress, but it basically works and was tested on a large code base.

Usage:

    $parser = new Parser();
    $parser->yyparse(
        new Lexer('<?php // some code'),
        function($stmt) {
            // this is the accept callback
            // it is fired in case of a successful parse
            // $stmts contains an array of nodes
            // to print them do:
            foreach ($stmts as $stmt) {
                echo $stmt, "\n";
            }
        },
        function($msg) {
            // this is the error callback
            // it is fired in case of an error (currently
            // errors abort the parse)
            echo $msg, "\n";
        }
    );
